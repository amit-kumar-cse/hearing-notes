### Discussion

* **We have 2 ways in life**
    * one is Bhoga and Aishwaraya
    * other is Samadhi (Self realization)
        * A person who will go on Bhoga and Aishwaraya path naturally cannot go on the path of self realization.
        * It is not possible to walk on both of these together. They are opposite directions. 180 degree to each other.
        * Samadhau na vidhiyate.
        * A person who desires enjoyment, The path of self realization is not possible for him.
